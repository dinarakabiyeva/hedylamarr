hl:quote_A_Childhood_1 a schema1:Quotation ;
    schema1:comment "This passage reveals how Hedy's childhood was shaped by Vienna's political and social turmoil after WWI. While her Jewish family faced growing antisemitism, her upbringing remained sheltered—a contrast that would later influence her complex relationship with identity and fame." ;
    schema1:isPartOf hl:A_Childhood ;
    schema1:pageStart "10-11" ;
    schema1:text """"Hedy was a child of the First World War, an event with sweeping repercussions for the Jews of Vienna. The collapse of the Hapsburg monarchy and the inauguration of the First Republic saw the Viennese Jews, along with the old aristocracy, stripped of their wealth and influence.
After the war, fuel shortages and a drastic lowering of living standards left Vienna more susceptible to the city's omnipresent anti-Semitism, and from the 1920s, the Viennese Jews were gradually becoming aware of a new, hostile atmosphere that infiltrated all aspects of society. No doubt the Kieslers felt the shock too, yet life for the young Hedy (pronounced
"Hady") was still protected and very traditional.\"""" .

hl:quote_Acapulco_1 a schema1:Quotation ;
    schema1:comment "Lewis's mockery of Hedy's accent lays bare Hollywood's exoticization of foreign stars. The \"disgust\" directed at her sexuality reveals the industry's hypocrisy—simultaneously profiting from and punishing her European sensibilities." ;

    schema1:pageStart "178" ;
    schema1:text "\"'I'm not proud of that film,' Lewis later told Peter Bogdanovich. 'But it proves one thing: that I'm capable of making a stinker.' It also proves how Hedy was still mocked as a foreigner in Hollywood-the comic rendition of her Germanic consonants in Lewis's unpleasant anecdote underlines this. Nor does its tone of disgust suggest a collaborative working relationship-Hedy meant not only foreignness but also an overheated (read foreign) sexuality that both threatened and titillated her director.\"" .

hl:quote_Casbah_1 a schema1:Quotation ;
    schema1:comment "This domestic vignette shows Hedy crafting her own space—literally and metaphorically—in Hollywood. Her hands-on design work mirrors her later inventive spirit, proving her talents extended far beyond the screen." ;

    schema1:text "\"In September 1938, now feeling assured of a Hollywood career, Hedy bought a house on North Camden Drive in Beverly Hills. With money to spend, she indulged her longtime interest in design. She decorated the house herself and built extra rooms. Then, she added a swimming pool and a pavilion in the garden where guests could change.\"" .

hl:quote_Ecstasy_1 a schema1:Quotation ;
    schema1:comment "The protests against Ecstasy highlight the duality of Hedy's early fame: criticized for both \"too much\" and \"not enough\" eroticism. The Jewish press's interpretation of the backlash hints at the undercurrent of antisemitism she navigated, even as her beauty overshadowed her artistry." ;

    schema1:pageStart "42" ;
    schema1:text """"In Frankfurt, screenings of the film were accompanied by protests that took the form of defacing the posters bearing the star's naked image. The protestors were divided into two camps: a Catholic youth organization that was opposed to the film's eroticism, particularly as promoted in its publicity, and filmgoers who were disappointed by its lack of erotic qual-ities.33 Again, the suggestion that the film had been banned in the 1930s because its star was Jewish was revived by the Jewish press.
[...]
In 1933, however, all this was yet to come and the film's beguiling star was still named Hedy Kiesler and only nineteen years old. She was, as far as most people were concerned, an exquisite Viennese mädl, whose acting abilities were as yet untested by a major dramatic role. Her reputation was the creation of men who were considerably older and worldlier than she. She would soon meet one more such man, her first husband,
Fritz Mandl.\"""" .

Like so many of the people who knew her well, Loder was adamant on another point: \"Hedy's best quality was that she was completely unimpressed by her own outstanding beauty. Indeed she seemed oblivious to it.\" He also adds that, \"she never flirted with other men, but then I think she was much more interested in success as a movie star than the opposite sex.\"\"" .

hl:quote_Filthy_story_1 a schema1:Quotation ;

I told him I thought several of my appearances in court contributed most to my satisfaction. Everyone acts all the time. I was my most natural and most convincing in court.\"' It's no wonder that, in later life, her favorite TV show was Judge Judy.\"" .

hl:quote_Filthy_story_2 a schema1:Quotation ;
    schema1:comment "The publisher's reduction of Hedy's life to \"mostly sexual\" experiences mirrors how Hollywood commodified her. The courtroom exchange lays bare the double standard: her marriages were framed as scandalous (while male stars' divorces were routine), and her attempt to control her narrative was dismissed as desperation. The phrase \"the only thing she had to sell was her sex\" crystallizes the industry's lifelong exploitation of her beauty." ;

         "We are dealing with the experiences, mostly sexual, of a woman out of pictures for fifteen years. She was in the doldrums as far as the picture business is concerned, and she was desperate to revive her name in the public mind. The only thing she had to sell was her sex 
         "This woman has been married to six men," he continued. "She discarded six of these husbands. But you and I are not interested in that." 
         "Do you think this is a filthy book?" Judge Nutter enquired of Pacht.

I'll probably go back to Berlin.\"' Any mention of a contract with Paramount and a trip to Hollywood with her mother vanished as unexpectedly as they had appeared. What she did not then know was that she had left Berlin and the Weimar film industry for good.\"" .

It is less surprising that she was deeply ungracious about her new career op-portunity, remarking that \"I'm just an old-fashioned housewife who has to do these TV things not to get into a rut.\" She no longer wished, she said, to continue to appear as a Mata Hari type?\"" .

hl:quote_Independence_1 a schema1:Quotation ;

As for her predilection for having affairs, this could be dismissed as meddlesome gossip, though it may well be true.

While there she overheard the assistant director say he would be interviewing actresses the next day to play a secretary. Hedy seized the opportunity: \"[…]Going to the assistant director, I said boldly, 'I want to play the part of the secretary?\"? According to Ecstasy and Me, her boldness landed her a small part in her first film: Alexis Granowsky's Storm in a Water Glass (Die Blumenfrau von Lin-denau/Sturm im Wasserglas). That assertion, however, was mistaken, as Storm was directed by Georg Jacoby in 1931, and Hedy's first film was actually Jacoby's Gold on the Street (Geld auf der Strasse), which was released by Sascha Film in 1930.\"" .

This startling fact has only become widely known in recent years; at the time it was reported in the news as a lesser item of interest.
Frequency-hopping, the system which has become associated with the actress and the composer, is a fairly straightforward process, although, in the years preceding and during World War Il, its finer points eluded the scientists of the day. The procedure involves sending a series of signals from a transmitter to a receiver in a manner that cannot be inter-cepted, thus allowing for a torpedo (for instance) to be dropped remotely.
Not only is it essential that the information pass from transmitter to receiver, it is also crucial that the message cannot be jammed by a third party.\"""" .
