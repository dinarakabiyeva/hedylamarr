# Hedy Lamarr Project

This repository contains a simple static website dedicated to the life and work of Hedy Lamarr. The site features a short biography, a list of selected films and a brief overview of her inventions.

## Local Development
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the page. The accompanying CSS and JavaScript files provide basic styling and form handling.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository on GitHub and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the `main` branch as the source.
3. After a few minutes your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>`.

The Hedy Lamarr image is embedded directly in `index.html` for ease of deployment.
